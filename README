  `fsock_sendc`: send frame to one or more connections at once. you can send to
    only one bounded address' connections or all incoming/outgoing connections.
  `fsock_close`: this will close all connections attached to socket. If you
    want, this will wait to send all remaining data to peers.
  benchmarks about latency and throughput.
  `fsock_bind`: this function will accept flags parameter and if you want, this
    will not bind to socket if socket already bounded. If you want, it will
    continue trying to bind until it can.
